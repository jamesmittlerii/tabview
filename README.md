Homework 11 - Tab View

Here we are asked to build an app with a tab view. This is a navigation style where there are tabs and panes...displaying the pane for the currently selected tab.

Tabs are a convenient way to get more information on the screen in an organized manner.

I chose to build three tabs with a Halloween candy theme. The view of each tab can contain just about anything; I just stuck with an image of the candy.

I also decided to put the details of each tab in a data structure and use a loop to populate the tabs.

I had some issues with the tab navigation icons not appearing on my phone in dark mode. Very odd. I think I finally figured out I needed to be compiling with IOS 26.0 even though I am targeting 18.
